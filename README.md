Definition  of Data type:
-->Data type in javascript define the type of data that can be stored and manipulated in a program 
-->JavaScript is a dynamically typed language ,meaning a variable can hold any data type and can be changed during runtime

Categories of Data type:
*Primitive Data Types:
  -->These are immutable and stored directly in the variable 
  -->Types include
         *String:Text data .e.g,"Hello"
         *Number:numeric data ,e.g,42,3.14
         *BigInt : Large Integer,e.g,12356n
         *Undefined : A variable that has been declared but not initialized.
         *Boolean : Logical Value ,true or false
         *Null:Represented Empty
         *Symbol:unique and immutable

*Non-Primitive Data type :
-->objects and collection ,mutable and complex
-->Types include
         *object:key-Value pair,e.g{name:"John"}
         *Array: Indexed Collection.e.g,[1,2,3]
         *Function: callable object,e.g,function(){....}
